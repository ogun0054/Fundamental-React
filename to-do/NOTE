Perfect 👍
Then we’ll do this **the right way**:
**small project + consistency plan**, without overwhelm.

I’ll keep this _simple, realistic, and confidence-building_.

# PART 1: A VERY SMALL SOLO REACT PROJECT (Confidence Builder)

This is **not** a “portfolio project”.
It’s a **learning project**.

## Project: “Simple Notes App”

(You can finish this — I promise.)

### What it does (only this 👇)

- A text input
- A button: **Add note**
- Notes appear in a list
- You can delete a note

That’s it.
No styling stress. No backend. No localStorage (yet).

---

### Concepts you’ll practice (from Jonas’ first part)

- `useState`
- Events (`onChange`, `onClick`)
- Rendering lists
- Passing props
- Basic component structure

---

### Component structure (simple)

```
App
 ├── NoteInput
 └── NotesList
      └── NoteItem
```

---

### Rules while building

- ❌ Don’t look at tutorials
- ✅ Look at **your course code**
- ✅ Use Google for errors
- ❌ Don’t try to “improve” it
- ✅ Just make it work

If you get stuck for **30 minutes**, that’s normal — keep going.

---

# PART 2: 2-WEEK REACT CONSISTENCY PLAN (Realistic)

This fits someone who:

- Prays
- Studies
- Wants barakah + progress
- Has struggled with inconsistency before (which you mentioned)

---

## DAILY RULE (Most Important)

🟢 **Minimum: 45 minutes**
🔵 **Ideal: 1–2 hours**

Even on bad days: **45 minutes counts as a win**.

---

## WEEK 1: Rebuild Foundation + Confidence

### Day 1–3

- Rewatch key lessons:

  - Components
  - JSX
  - Props
  - `useState`

- Code along fully
- After each lesson:
  👉 Rebuild a **tiny example** from memory

---

### Day 4–5

- Start the **Simple Notes App**
- Don’t rush
- Break things
- Fix errors

---

### Day 6

- Finish the app
- Clean code lightly
- Reflect:

  - “What do I now understand better?”

---

### Day 7

- Rest OR light revision
- No guilt

---

## WEEK 2: Strengthen + Move Forward

### Day 8–10

- Continue Jonas’ course
- Watch **consistently**
- Pause often
- Type everything

---

### Day 11–12

- Rebuild **one small feature** from the course
  (without watching)

---

### Day 13

- Add **one improvement** to Notes App
  (example: edit note OR clear all)

---

### Day 14

- Review progress
- Write what improved
- Plan next project

---

# VERY IMPORTANT MINDSET SHIFT (Please read)

❌ “I should already be good at this”
✅ “I am training my brain”

❌ “I don’t feel confident yet”
✅ “Confidence comes _after_ repetition”

React rewards **patience + consistency**, not intelligence.

## One small action for TODAY

Today, just do this:

1. Open your React setup
2. Create the Notes App folder
3. Add only:

   - input
   - button
   - console.log()

That’s enough for today.

---

If you want, next we can:

- Build the Notes App **step by step together**, or
- Adjust this plan around your **prayer + daily schedule**, or
- Decide **when you’re ready** to move to a bigger project

Just tell me which one you want next.
